Unpack the zip by pointing it to the 3dsmax root directory.
Should work with 3dsmax 2010 and newer.

If you cannot unpack it then try to run it again by right-clicking and selecting 'run as administrator' (7zip \ winrar etc).
Some OS'es needs administrator rights to unpack to programfiles directory.
