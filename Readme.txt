To create a zip archive of the latest LuxMax simply clone the source, or download it as zip.

Unpack it to a folder on your machine, and run 'Create_Installer.bat'.
It will then create a zip archive in the 'Installer' folder, unpack this to the root of your 3dsmax.
If you have a older version installed - then simply overwrite all files when you unpack.

It works for 3dsamax 2010 and newer (X32 and X64).
